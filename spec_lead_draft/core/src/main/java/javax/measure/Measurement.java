/**
 * Represents a value with a unit.
 * 
 * A Measurement object is used for maintaining the tuple of value and unit.
 * </br> Arithmetic methods are provided. At least a runtime error (for some
 * operations already at compile time) will occur when two measurements are used
 * in an incompatible way. E.g., when a speed (m/s) is added to a distance (m).
 * The measurement class will correctly track changes in unit during
 * multiplication and division, always coercing the result to the most simple
 * form. See <type>Unit</type> for more information on the supported units.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Measurement instances should be immutable.
 * </p>
 * 
 * @param <Q>
 *            The type of the quantity measured.
 * @param <V>
 *            The value of the quantity measured.
